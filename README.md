# Udacity-Query-a-Digital-Music-Store-Database
In this project, I will query the Chinook Database; a Digital Music Store Database. I will be using SQL to assist the Chinook team with understanding the media in their store, their customers and employees, and their invoice information.

To assist in the queries ahead, the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the Chinook Database is provided below. You can see the columns that link tables together via the arrows.

I will come up with some questions that can be answered with SQL. The questions must be complex enough to where the SQL used to answer it requires at least one JOIN and one Aggregation.

Also, attached a presentation that include:
- One visualization per slide (I will export my query results from SQL Workbench to a csv and use Excel to create an appropriate chart).
- A 1-2 sentence explanation of each slide.
